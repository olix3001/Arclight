:warning: **Warning:** Arclight currently does not work, It is only a language specification. I'm still working on creating a working compiler for It.

## :rocket: Getting started

:hourglass_flowing_sand: Currently this language is still in development, this section will be added when alpha release is available.

## :telescope: Goals

    1. Simple syntax.
    2. Easy to learn.
    3. Capable of creating complex programs.
    4. Memory safety.

:pencil: If you know something about compilers, you know rust and want to join this project just leave an Issue with "I want to join" template.

## :blue_book: Specification

To see language specification visit [spec](/spec/lang/) directory. Or if you want to see the standard library documentation visit [std spec](/spec/std/).
