### Enums

Basic enums are defined as

```
enum Enum {
    A,
    B
}
```

And are just a nice way to make your code readable, this type of enums will be compiled as integers, where in this example `Enum::A` will be compiled into `0u8`.

As it can be seen before, Values from enums can be accessed using static get operator `::`
.
