### Module definition

Module is like a namespace, it is used mainly to clean up the code when you import something.

It can be defined using

```
module ModuleName { ... }
```

Where `...` can be classes, functions or constant values.

If you want value from module to be accessible from the outside, you should use `public` keyword before it.
